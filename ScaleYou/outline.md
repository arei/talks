SYNOPSIS

	The software industry ranks the various levels of a software engineer, from Junior to Mid to Senior to Principal to Lead, usually in terms of years of experience. But that does not really do the differences between these roles justice does it. This talk will throw out the idea of "years of experience" as a distinguisher in engineer career levels and instead suplant them with the ideas of scale of work, knowledge, leadership, and communication. Join me as I tell you the real secret of moving up in your company and increasing your value.

	The point is that these are all the same job.
	
	The only differentiator is how many years 
	of working as a software engineer
	the job is "demanding".

	But "years of experience" means nothing.
	As a measure it lacks any meaningful substance.
	Its like assuming someone would be good at a job
	because their last name has 10 characters in it.

	So, why do companies do this?
	Why do we use "years of experience"
	as a yard stick for skill?

10	Anyone want to take a guess
	at the magic answer I'm thinking of in my head?

	HR

	See, a company is a collection of employees
	All working toward a common goal.
	But each employee is vastly different.
	They are their own individuals.
	With their own strengths and weakness.
	And their own skills and talents.

	But managing individuals is really hard
	And taking the time to care aboutt people individually
	is a lot of work.

	So HR doesnt do that.
	Instead they bucket people.
	
	They bucket the employees into groups.
	These people are all sales, so they go over here.
	These people are all finance, so they go over here.
	These people are all software engineer, so they go over here.

	And then they apply rules against those buckets.
	This lets HR deal with all the differences in employees
	while doing the least amount of work possible.
	
	But its completely misses the point
	of hiring individuals
	and playing to the strengths and weaknesses
	of those individuals.

	In software engineering
	One of the key buckets HR uses is your "level".
	Are you a Junior?
	Or a Mid?
	Or a Senior?
	Or a Princiapl?

	These buckets help HR determine your worth to the company.
	How much they should pay you?
	How much responsibility they can place in you?
	How much thet can expect of you?
	How much value do you add to the company?

20	But circling back to the Job Descriptions I brought up earlier...
	These buckets dont actually answer any of these questions.
	They only answer one question:
	How long have you been sitting at your desk.

	It is entirely possible
	To work in a company
	For multiple years
	Without doing anything more
	Than occupying space.

	Believe me.

	So lets blow it up.
	Let us throw out the notion of "Years of Experience".
	Let us instead imagine a better way to judge
	a Software Engineers "level".

	But before we can do that
	We need to sidetrack into motivations.
	What motiviations drive Software Engineers to work.
	And how do those motiviations drive their job search?
	
	This is going to be just the top items, 
	not every little thing. 
	Also, I'm generalizing here. 
	Everyone is different.
	I just said that like two minutes ago.
	Deal with it.

	1. Getting Paid
	Lets face it, we work to get paid.
	Yes, many of us would work even if we didnt get paid
	Because we love what we do
	But we most certainly would not be
	working on whatever it is your company wants us to do.
	we'd all be making video games.
	
	2. Technical Challenge
	People in software like to solve problems.
	And there is nothing like overcoming a juice problem.
	So we want to be challenged. 
	But not overwhelmed. 
	Something in the sweet spot that forces us to grow
	without being completely over our heads.

	3. Creative Opportunity
	Software is as much an art as it is a science.
	As such, there is a strong component of Creation in the work that we do.
	Yet must companies already have the "plan" all mapped out.
	And they chance to be creative is very micro-ized.
	Thus as we grow in our career we seek out greater opportunites
	to be in a role that allows great chance to be creative.

	4. Influence
	As you grow in your career
	you will also seek out the opportunity 
	to wield influence within the company.
	How much are my words being heard throughout the company?
	How does that work I do impact others?
	Some might call this Authority and Management
	But there are a lot of ways to influence
	without being the boss or acting bossy.

30	5. Avoiding Hassle
	Nobody wants to work in a company that sucks.
	And nobody wants to go to that stupid 
	weekly all hands meeting every friday morning.
	So whether or not we choose to admit it
	One of our underlying motiviations
	Is to avoid work place stress...
	Aka avoid hassle.

	So these are 
	In my opinion 
	The motiviations that we
	as software engineers
	look for in our work.

	And we can measure these.
	We can rate them from a 1 to 10
	With 1 being Low and 10 being high.
	
	So for my current role
	Pay ............ 9
	Challenge ...... 4
	Creativity ..... 6
	Influence ...... 7
	Avoid Hassle ... 7
	I am very well paid,
	I am not very challenged,
	I am somewhat given the chance to be creative
	I am somewhat influential in the company
	and I am able to avoid a moderate amount of hassle

	And as we grow in our career
	we expect these numbers to grow to.
	I expect that as I move from mid to senior
	I am going to increase Pay, and Challenge, and Creativity, and Influence.

	And as a company changes around us
	we expect these numbers to change as well.
	And not always for the better.
	It is when these number drop down to 1s and 2s
	that people leave.

	So now that we have some baselines for motiviations
	we can look at how those motiviations translate to levels.

	For a Junior we'd expect...
	Low Pay
	Low Creativity
	Low Influence
	Low Avoiding Hassle
	But interestingly enough, high Challenge,
	because, this is after all, usually the entry point
	and there's a lot of learning to be done.

	For a Mids we'd expect...
	Low-Medium Pay
	Moderate Challenge
	Low-Medium Creativity
	Low Influence
	Low Avoiding Hassle
	
	For a Seniors...
	Medium Pay
	Moderate Challenge
	Medium Creativity
	Medium Influence
	Medium Avoiding Hassle

40	For a Principal...
	High Pay
	High Challenge
	High Creativity
	Medium Influence
	Low Avoiding Hassle

	These, of course, fluxuate from job to job,
	but generally you get the idea.

	So these are our software levels.

	And to take it back to the HR buckets.
	These are the "Years of Experience" expectations
	that correspond to these roles
	Junior ...... 1 to 2 years
	Mid ......... 2 to 5 years
	Senior ...... 5 to 10 years
	Principal ... 10 to 20 years

	As if occupying space for some magic period of time
	Qualifies me to wield more influence in the company
	or makes me more effective at being creative.

	It's bunk.
	Junk Science.
	Fake News.

	And even if your company subscribes to this,
	and I assure you they do,
	HR does not magically promote you based on your
	work anniversary.

	"Wow, Kirill has been with us 5 years. 
	I guess he's a Senior Software Engineer now. 
	Better give him more money 
	and more influence in the company."

	So you see, 
	"Years of Experience" 
	is an utterly worthless metric.
	Why we use this in hiring at all
	is a complete mystery
	and ultimately failing the company entirely.

	<PAUSE>

	Alright,
	So I am 50 slides or so in.
	And All I've done is bitch about HR.
	And I promise I was going to talk about
	how you, as a software engineer,
	level-up your carreer.
	
50	If the magic "Years of Experience" number is worthless
	for you to level up your career by,
	what do you use instead?

	Well, the answer to that sort of lies in our motivations.
	(Its not a perfect comparison, but bear with me...)

	1. Getting Paid > Knowledge
	We are fundamentally knowledge workers. 
	This mean the knowledge we have
	and the application of that knowledge
	is what we are selling,
	what we are getting paid for.
	So the greater our knowledge, 
	the more we get paid.
	
	2. Technical Challenge > Tenacity
	The tenacity we bring to bear for our company
	the passion to dig into a problem and solve it
	no matter how hard that problem might be
	that is what makes us valuable.

	3. Creative Opportunity > Insight
	The opportunity to be creative in your work
	takes many forms in a company
	But the value lies in your ability to provide
	new insights and new innovations.
	Insight and Innovation is the expression of your creativity.
	
	4. Influence > Leadership
	Influence is earned, not rewarded,
	and in order to earn it you must demonstrate it.
	This seems kind of chicken and egg like,
	but really there are lots of ways to lead.
	By demonstrating that you are a leader,
	You earn influence.

	5. Avoiding Hassle > Communication
	90% of all hassle is actually
	a breakdown in communication.
	Its a failure by some party to communicate effectively.
	So by being an effective communicator
	you are actually striving to reduce the hassle
	for yourself and others.

	So if we take these transformations of 
	our 5 motivations into
	our 5 Growth Channels
	we can begin to see the ways
	in which we can achieve great success
	within the company, for the company.

	These 5 Growth Channels
	are how you scale.

	To be clear
	I'm not saying 
	Growing in any one of these channels
	Alone is going to get your promoted

60	But it will make you a more valuable employee.
	It will make you a more valuable job candidate.
	It will make you a more successful engineer.

	Cool. 
	But how do I grow in these areas?

	Knowledge
		- Always be open to learning new technology.
		- Never be afraid to try a new way of doing something.
		- Stay current via newsletters, podcasts, and meetups.

	Tenacity
		- Demonstrate Tenacity by not giving up.
		- But know when to ask for help.
		- And always be eager to help others, even if you dont know the answer.

	Insight
		- Never be afraid to suggest a different approach, even if everyone disagrees.
		- Always try to look at the problem from a different angle.
		- Champion your ideas; no one else will.
		- Dont stay silent, challenge the status quo.

	Leadership
		- ALWAYS Help Others.
		- Champion other people's ideas; and make sure they get the credit.
		- Listen.
		- Praise.
		- Participate.
		- Take ownership.
		- Own your shit.

	Communication
		- Be verbose.
		- Write everything; design docs, documentation, missives.
		- Speak up.
		- Give Talks.
		- Make small talk.

	So that's it.
	That's my advice to Scaling you
	and advancing to the next level.
	
	But before I leave you
	A couple of other small things
	I have learned over a very long career
	that I think can help you out.

	1. Change jobs
	There is no disputing the math here.
	Stay in your current job, get a 3% raise.
	Change jobs, get a 10% raise.
	Yes, I do understand a job is more than just money.
	And the other 4 motivations we discussed illustrate that.
	But money is a big part of that.
	My advice for new people starting their career is always the same.
	Stay in your first job for 2 years, then switch every 1 to 3 years after that.
	Sure you will get some bad jobs along the way
	So you just move on.

70	2. Dont Coast
	I see so many software engineer coasting. 
	They just do their job, collect their pay check, go home and watch TV.
	That's fine, but they are actively choosing to not grow.

	3. Scope of work
	As you grow in your career
	you will be tasked with projects that
	are increasingly larger in scope.
	At the Junior level your scope is very small, the file/class/function scope.
	At the Mid level it expands, the folder level; a collection of classes, a feature.
	At the senior level is expands again, the system level; how a large system works all together.
	At the principal level you are usually at the product level; how does the entire product work together.
	Beyond principal, you are generally working at the company level; how do all the products work together.

	4. Advocate for Yourself
	Nobody is going to toot your horn for you.
	You must be your own marketing department.
	Make sure that when you do something you think
	is clever or cool or exciting
	that you share it with your leadership
	and your peers.

	5. Speak Up
	You dont have to be the loudest person in the meeting
	But you should always be part of the meeting.
	Even if its only to ask a question 
	or to echo someone else point.
	Being queit is not doing you any favors.
	And I know it sometimes can be very hard to speak up
	when there are a lot of other loud people never yielding the floor.
	Find a way. Raise you fucking hand if you have to.

	6. Encourage Others
	Always encourage your peers, your boss, your employees.
	If someone says something you agree with, echo and give credit.
	Raise people up around you.

	Alright.
	I've given you a lot of advice here.
	Take it or not.
	But I've worked a very long time in this industry.
	From small companies to big ones.
	I've done every job from Intern to Director to Founder to CTO.
	And everything I have talked about tonight
	Has served me exceptionally well in my career.
	Hopefully it will serve you as well.
	
	I'm not saying it wont be easy.
	I'm not saying it wont have problems.
	I am saying that its infinitely better
	than waiting for HR to magically notice
	you've been working for 5 years
	and are suddenly ready for more pay and responsibility.

77	Thank you.
