Advancing Focus

Some things in web development just work; they do what they are supposed to do day in and day out, and we don't ever have to worry about them. It's the "little engine that could" story: it's reliable, it stable, it's trustworthy. The Focus subsystem is one such system... reliable, stable, trustworthy, but is it good... does it meet the needs of modern web development? This talk delves into the Focus subsystem for Web Browsers and asks us to consider is there more it could be doing and how do we make it happen?

Greetings.

If you could all focus on me.

<pause>

Do you see what I just did there?

I started a talk
about focus
by asking you to focus
Clever huh?

My name is Glen.

And today I'm here to talk to you about
Focus.

Not focus like I just asked for,
not the focus of attention,
but the user interface version of focus,
In our browsers.

User Interface focus
is about the browser
determining what element
gets user input events.

A user input event is
a key press or release
a mouse click
a screen tap
an assistance device input
a clipboard paste

A user input event
