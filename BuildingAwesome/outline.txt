An introduction to using three new libraries from Awesome Engineering
to rapidly build any enterprise ready API Server. Specifically will
touch upon AwesomeServer, AwesomeLog, and AwesomeConfig, and how the
three are used to build out an API server.

-----------------------

[Brian Poeshen Slide]

Hello, My name is Glen.

You may know me from such other famous talks as

[slide]

Debugging while Drunk:
The Silent Killer

and

[slide]

For Loops:
The Silent Killer

And, of course, who could forget,

[slide]

Using React:
The Silent Killer.

But today I want to talk to YOU
about how YOU TOO can be

[pause]
[slide]

AWESOME!

Today I'm going to introduce you to
three new(ish) libraries
that you can use
to build a really awesome API Server.

[slide]

AwesomeLog
for easy, smart logging.

[slide]

AwesomeConfig
config files like you've always dreamed about

and finally
AwesomeServer
your one stop HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2 Server

Today I will show you
each of these three libraries
and how you can use them
to build a
quick
easy
stable
API Server

[slide]

But before I jump into the code
I wanted to mention a little bit
about my motivations in writing
these three libraries (and more to come).

[blank slide]

The packages you choose to use
when building nodejs projects,
or any software projects for that matter,
are libraries you need to trust
maintained by people you need to trust.

When you install a package like express

[slide]

you are actually installing 48 separate packages.

[slide]

48 separate licenses that you need to review
with your legal team
48 separate maintainers you have to
work with when things go awry.
48 separate problems you have to
solve when its time to debug.

So when I sat down to write the Awesome libraries
My goals were very clear:

Build a set of tools
that are engineered to work together;
that are free from external dependencies;
that are maintained by a single organization;
that are consistently licensed by a single licensor.

Essentially
I set out to create
A single point of trust.

[slide]

And it is my hope
that when you have to make a choice
about your libraries
we will have earned you patronage,
we will have earned your trust.

[pause]

So, with that said,
lets take a look at our libraries.

[slide]

We begin with AwesomeLog.

[slide]

AwesomeLog provides a basic
out of the box
logging solution that is
ready to go with
zero configuration
but also allows for a
highly configurable
logging solution
to handle your logging right.

But really, let me just show you how to use it.

[slide]

We start, obviously, by installing it.

	npm install @awesomeeng/awesome-log

[slide]

Once installed, we can use AwesomeLog right away.

In our application,
as close to the entry point
of your application as possible

	const Log = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-log");
	Log.init();
	Log.start();

That's it.  AwesomeLog will spin itself up
and start handling any Log calls you make,
like this:

[slide]

	Log.info("Hello there world.");

Once you've started AwesomeLog you can use
it any where in your application*
without needing to initialize or start it again.
You just require it,
and use it:

	const Log = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-log");
	Log.debug("My god, it's full of bugs!");

Because AwesomeLog was initialized
at the top of your application,
reinitializing it in each module,
or passing the Log object around
is unnecessary.

[slide]

I mentioned also that AwesomeLog
is highly configurable.

When you initialize AwesomeLog,
you may pass an optional configuration object
to change AwesomeLog from its defaults.

For example, by default AwesomeLog has five logging levels:
Access, Error, Warn, Info and Debug.

Say we wanted to add a new level: SILLY

[slide]

We just tell AwesomeLog during initialization
our new configuration,
and AwesomeLog handles the rest.

	Log.init({
		levels: "access,error,warn,info,debug,silly"
	});
	Log.start();

Now we can do

	Log.silly("this is an ex-parrot");

Anywhere we like.

There is a lot more you can do with AwesomeLog with just a little configuration...

[slide]

CSV or JSON output

Log.init({
	writers: [{
		name: "MyConsoleWriter",
		type: "console",
		formatter: "csv",
		options: {
			colorize: true
		}
	}],
});

Log.init({
	writers: [{
		name: "MyConsoleWriter",
		type: "console",
		formatter: "json",
		options: {
			colorize: true
		}
	}],
});

[slide]

Log to a File

	Log.init({
	    writers: [{
	        name: "MyConsoleWriter",
	        type: "console",
	        formatter: "default",
	        options: {
	            colorize: true
	        }
	    },{
	        name: "MyFileWriter",
	        type: "file",
	        formatter: "json",
	        options: {
	            filename: "logs/MyLogs.{YYYYMMDD}.log"
	        }
	    }],
	});

[slide]

Or add your own formats or writers:

	Log.defineFormatter("my-custom-formatter","./My-Custom-Formatter.js");
	Log.defineWriter("my-custom-writer","./My-Custom-Writer.js");

	Log.init({
		writers: [{
			name: "MyCustomLogs",
			type: "my-custom-writer",
			formatter: "my-custom-formatter"
		}],
	});

[slide]

And lots more...

	Ready to go with zero initial configuration;
	Configure and Start once, Use Everywhere;
	Support for clean nested AwesomeLog usage;
	Customizable Log Levels;
	Configurable log entry field contents;
	Built-In Formatters: Default, JSON, JS, or CSV;
	Or add your own log formatters;
	Console and File writers;
	or add your own custom log writer;
	Colorized Console Logging;
	Log History;
	Pause/Resume;
	SubProcess Logging;

[slide]

But it's best if you just read the documentation:

	npm repo @awesomeeng/awesome-log

[pause]

[slide]

Lets move on to our next library
AwesomeConfig.

[slide]

AwesomeConfig provides a unified,
transparent configuration object
to your application
based on configuration files or objects that you define.
It includes support for
Inline or File based configuration,
conditional configuration sections,
variables to reference one part of your configuration from another;
and lots more.

Once again, let me just show you.

[slide]

we start by installing it.

	npm install @awesomeeng/awesome-config

After installed
Setting up config happens in four steps.
Like AwesomeLog, we recommend you do this
as close to the top of your application as possible.

[slide]

1: Require it.

	const config = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-config");

[slide]

2: Initialize it.

	config().init();

[slide]

3: Add zero or more configuration objects or files:

	config().add("./AwesomeConfig1.json");
	config().add({
		user: {
			name: "Bob"
		}
	});

[slide]

4: Once all our config is added, we start AwesomeConfig.

	config().start();

[slide]

AwesomeConfig is now up and running and you can access
your configuration using the config object.

	console.log("Hello there "+config.user.name);
	console.log("Greetings from "+config.user.location);

So a few key things to note that
some of you might have noticed...

[slide]

First, when calling methods
like init() or add() or start()
we using the config() method signature.

[slide]

But when accessing the config data,
we use the config object dot notation.

This is a little trick
to prevent our config functions
from being overwritten
by our config data
and it allows AwesomeConfig
to have zero reserved words.

[slide]

Second, config is completely immutable.
the only way to change configuration
is via the add() method.
And once start() is called,
add() can no longer be called.

[slide]

Third, you can call add()
with either a JavaScript Object
or a filename.
If a filename is used,
AwesomeConfig will read that file
and if it is a valid config use it.

[slide]

Fourth, you can call add() as many times as you want,
adding multiple config objects/files.

When you call start(),
AwesomeConfig will merge all the configurations together
into a unified configuration object
overwriting earlier config values
with latter ones.

[slide]

Finally, we used JSON in all of the examples,
and that's fine if you like that sort of thing.
but AwesomeConfig really works best when you use
the AwesomeConfig Notation.

AwesomeConfig notation is almost identical to JSON,
but with a few added bonuses:

	/* API Server configuration */
	{
		"server": {
			"scheme": "http",
			"hostname": "localhost",
			"port": 1234,
			"cert": null,
			"key": null,
			"url": "${server.scheme}://${server.hostname}:${server.port}"
		}
	}

	[env:target=local]
	server.port: 8080

	[env:target=test]
	server.port: 80

	[env:target=production]
	server: {
		"hostname": "0.0.0.0",
		"port": 443,
		"scheme": "https",
		"cert": "./MyCertificate.pub",
		"key": "./MyCertificate.pri"
	}

[slide]

	Comments

[slide]

	JSON Blocks

[slide]

	key/value pairs

[slide]

	JSON and key/values together

[slide]

	Variables

	Variables allow you to reference
	one part of your configuration
	from another part of your configuration.

[slide]

	Conditions

	Conditions precede a section of configuration
	and that configuration is only applied
	if the conditions evaluate true.

	Variables and conditions when used
	together can be really powerful.

[slide]

There are a lot of other features to AwesomeConfig

	Add configuration from files, directories, as JSON, or as a plain javascript objects;
	Uses JSON notation or our custom notation that supports mixing JSON style config and key/value style config;
	Globally accessible config without the need to pass config objects around;
	Configuration is exposed as a plain JavaScript object for easy usage;
	Support for namespace instances to isolate usage as needed;
	Configuration is immutable once started;
	Configuration Variables allow cross referencing other parts of your configuration;
	Configuration Conditions allow you to toggle on/off different parts of your configuration based on external values like hostname, OS, or environment variables.
	Configuration Placeholders to force users to provide key configuration values.
	No reserved words.

[slide]

But like before it's best if you just read the documentation:

	npm repo @awesomeeng/awesome-config

[pause]

[slide]

Last but not least,
I'd like to introduce you to AwesomeServer.

[slide]

AwesomeServer is an easy to setup
HTTP or
HTTPS or
HTTP/2
server
allowing you to provide flexible
routing and controllers
for responding to incoming requests
in a consistent, repeatable, performant fashion.

[slide]

Once again, let me just show you.

we start by installing it.

	npm install @awesomeeng/awesome-server

[slide]

After we install
Setting up AwesomeServer happens in five steps.

[slide]

1: Require it.

	const AwesomeServer = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-server");

[slide]

2: Instantiate it.

	let server = new AwesomeServer();

[slide]

3: Add Servers

	server.addHTTPServer({
		hostname: "localhost",
		port: 8080
	});

[slide]

4: Add routes

	server.route("GET","/test",(path,request,response)=>{
		return response.writeHTML("Hello World!");
	});

[slide]

5: Go!

	server.start();

AwesomeServer is now up and running on port 8080 and
serving requests:

	curl http://localhost:8080/test


There are two key parts to setting up AwesomeServer
Adding Servers
And
Routing

[slide]

The first key part of setup is
Adding Servers

You add a server to an instance of AwesomeServer.

You may add multiple servers to the same instance
and each will handle the same routing,
just from different entry points.
Thus you can have both an HTTP
and an HTTPS served by the same instance
handling the same requests.

AwesomeServer supports
HTTP
HTTPS
and HTTP2 servers.
Additionally you could,
if you wanted to,
write your own customer server.

[slide]

You add a server with the addServer() method,
but there are shortcuts for HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP2.
addHTTPServer()
addHTTPSServer()
addHTTP2Server()

[slide]

Each of these shortcuts takes a configuration object
which describes the hostname and port to bind to.
For HTTPS and HTTP2 server you would also
need to include your public and private
certificates for the underlying TLS security.

[slide]

The second key part of setup is adding routes.

The simplest form of adding a route
is the route() command.

	server.route(method,path,handler);

the route command takes three arguments:

[slide]

The METHOD
which corresponds to the HTTP Method
of the incoming request.
GET, HEAD, POST, etc.

You may also specify the "*" character
to match ALL methods.

[slide]

The PATH
describes how to match the incoming requests
path to this specific route.

Paths can either be
Exact
Starts With
Ends With
Contains
RegEx
or an OR EXPRESSION separated by PIPE "|" characters

[slide]

The HANDLER can be

a function with the following signature

	server.route("GET","/blah",(path,request,response) => {
		...
	});

[slide]

a Controller Class

	server.route("*","/blah",(class MyController extends AwesomeServer.AbstractContoller {
		get(path,request,response) {
			... handle GET request ...
		}
	}));

[slide]

A filename to a Controller Class

	server.route("*","/blah","./MyController.js");

[slide]

or a directory name to a collection of Controller classes

	server.route("*","/blah","./controllers");

Controllers provide
a structured way to organize your code
around a specific endpoints
and are the recommended router approach.

The filename and directory versions of server.route()
make it really easy to define controllers
and tie them to your code without
getting bogged down in giant mess
of code spagetti.

[slide]

There are a lot of other features to AwesomeServer

	Easy to use.
	HTTP support.
	HTTPS support.
	HTTP/2 support including push routing for preloading.
	Or mix and match all three types of servers.
	Basic routing to channel HTTP Method X along path Y into predefined functions.
	Advanced routing using Controllers that takes your routing to the next level.
	Controllers from classes, files, or whole directory trees.
	Support for serving static files or whole directories to specific routes.
	Easy built-in redirects.
	Built around native promises and ready for async/await.
	Integrated with AwesomeLog for easy logging if you want it.
	Add your own custom servers beyond HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP/2.

[slide]

But like before it's best if you just read the documentation:

	npm repo @awesomeeng/awesome-server

[pause]

[slide]

So for our final part of tonight,
lets put all three libraries together.

[slide]

For this example we are going to write a quick API Server
that will server up images of kittens.
It will have two endpoints:

	GET /kittens - return a list of all kitten ids
	GET /kittens/<id> - return a specific kitten image.

Additionally, we will log each request we get out.

Finally, we will provide both a local environment configuration
and a production environment configuration.

[slide]

I'm going to visually walk through this
on the slides here
then I'll switch over to the code
and run it all for you
to see it in action.

[slide]

STEP 1: Install our libraries:

	npm install @awesomeeng/awesome-server
	npm install @awesomeeng/awesome-log
	npm install @awesomeeng/awesome-config

[slide]

STEP 2: Write a controller

	We are going to use a Controller in AwesomeServer
	to handle our incoming request.

	So lets write that first.

	We start out simple enough

		const AwesomeServer = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-server");

		class KittenController extends AwesomeServer.AbstractController {
			get(path,request,response) {
			}
		}

	We have two types of get requests we want to service
	with this controller.

		GET /kittens - returns a list of all kitten ids.
		GET /kittens/<id> - returns the kitten's picture.

	So lets add some logic to our get() to separate the two:

		const AwesomeServer = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-server");

		class KittenController extends AwesomeServer.AbstractController {
			get(path,request,response) {
				if (path==="") return getKittenIds(path,request,response);
				else return getSpecificKitten(path,request,response);
			}
		}

	Now, lets implement the getKittensId() function

	The key point is that we are going to
	get a list of all the .jpg files on the disk
	trim the .jpg off those names,
	and return that as a json array of our ids.

		const Path = require("path");
		const FS = require("fs");

		const AwesomeServer = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-server");

		class KittenController extends AwesomeServer.AbstractController {
			get(path,request,response) {
				if (path==="") return getKittenIds(path,request,response);
				else return getSpecificKitten(path,request,response);
			}
		}

return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
	try {
		path = Path.resolve(".")
		FS.readdir(path,async (err,files)=>{
			if (err) return await response.writeError(500,err);

			files = files.filter((filename)=>{
				return filename.endsWith(".jpg");
			});
			files = files.map((filename)=>{
				return Path.basename(filename,".jpg");
			});
			await response.writeJSON(files);

			resolve();
		});
	}
	catch (ex) {
		return reject(ex);
	}
});

	And then we will implement our getSpecificKitten() method.

		const Path = require("path");
		const FS = require("fs");

		const AwesomeServer = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-server");

		class KittenController extends AwesomeServer.AbstractController {
			get(path,request,response) {
				if (path==="") return getKittenIds(path,request,response);
				else return getSpecificKitten(path,request,response);
			}
		}

		return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
			try {
				path = Path.resolve(".")
				FS.readdir(path,async (err,files)=>{
					if (err) return await response.writeError(500,err);

					files = files.filter((filename)=>{
						return filename.endsWith(".jpg");
					});
					files = files.map((filename)=>{
						return Path.basename(filename,".jpg");
					});
					await response.writeJSON(files);

					resolve();
				});
			}
			catch (ex) {
				return reject(ex);
			}
		});

		const getSpecificKitten = function getKitten(id,request,response) {
			Log.debug("Received request to return specific Kitten "+id+".");
			return response.serve(200,"image/jpeg",Path.resolve("./"+id+".jpg"));
		};

	You might have noticed that
	we are doing some things with the response object
	that isnt quite standard:
	In AwesomeServer each request and response is wrapped
	in a special Request or Response wrapper
	that adds a collection of shortcuts
	to help dealing with request and response.

	Request gets shortcuts for
	getting key request data
	and shortcuts for reading POSTed data.

	Response gets shortcuts for
	writing and serving content.
	In getSpecificKitten()
	for example,
	we use response.serve()
	to serve a file from disk,
	straight to the response.

	To round it all out we need to export our class:

		module.exports = KittenController;

STEP 3: Write the Server

	Next we are going to write the Server code.

	We start by requiring our three libraries:

		const AwesomeServer = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-server");
		const Log = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-log");
		const config = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-config");

	Next, lets setup and start our logging:

		Log.init();
		Log.start();
		Log.debug("Log started.");

	And also our configuration stuff:

		config().init();
		config().add("./config.json");
		config().start();
		Log.debug("Config started.");

	Now, we add our server code:

let server = new AwesomeServer();
server.addHTTPServer({
	hostname: config.server.hostname,
	port: config.server.port
});
server.route("*","*",(path,request,response)=>{
	Log.access("Request from "+request.origin+" to "+request.url.href+".");
});
server.route("*","/kittens|/kittens/*","./KittenController.js");
server.start();
Log.debug("Server started.");

Here we are adding two routes:
The first one matches every single request that comes in
and the handler writes a log message for each.
The second route matches /kittens or /kittens/*
and routes that to our controller.

Also, our code has two tricky bits to be aware of...
Both Log.start() and server.start() are asyncronous methods
and return a promise...
But we'd like them to act syncronously here.
async/await to the rescue.

So we can just stick an await command
in from of Log.start() and server.start()

For those of you whom might remember my talk
about async/await
a few months back
you may recall that I told you
that you can only use an await
inside of an async function.
and currently the top level
of your code, where we are now,
is not an async function.

So here's a little magic to get
around that sticking point:
we just wrap everything in an async IIFE!

		(async ()=>{
			// startup logging
			Log.init();
			await Log.start();
			Log.debug("Log started.");

			// startup config
			config().init();
			config().add("./config.json");
			await config().start();
			Log.debug("Config started.");

			// startup server
			let server = new AwesomeServer();
			server.addHTTPServer({
				hostname: config.server.hostname,
				port: config.server.port
			});
			server.route("*","*",(path,request,response)=>{
				Log.access("Request from "+request.origin+" to "+request.url.href+".");
			});
			server.route("*","/kittens|/kittens/*","./KittenController.js");
			await server.start();
			Log.debug("Server started.");
		})();

	Finally, we can add a little Log message to
	the end and let us know its all running.

		// Log out our success
		Log.debug("Kittens running at "+config.server.url);

STEP 4: Configuration

	We are using a configuration file
	which we called config.json
	so let's go ahead and create that.

		/* Our base, which is also our local server configuration */

		{
			"server": {
				"scheme": "http",
				"hostname": "localhost",
				"port": 8080,
				"url": "${server.scheme}://${server.hostname}:${server.port}"
			}
		}

		/* our production environment settings */

		[env:target=production]
		{
			"server": {
				"hostname": "0.0.0.0",
				"port": 80
			}
		}

	The config file describes a base configuration
	and a conditional configuration
	tied to the TARGET environment variable.

	If TARGET equals PRODUCTION
	our configuration will be
	a merge of the base configuration
	and the conditional configuration.

	If Target is anything else
	our configuration will be
	only the base configuration.

	Also, just a quick notice of the use
	of the configuration Variables
	for server.url.
	Depending on our TARGET again
	the variable will resolve differently.

STEP 5: A little more logging

	Let's go back to our controller
	and sprinkle some additional logging
	statements in there:

		const Log = require("@awesomeeng/awesome-log");

		...

		Log.debug("Received request to return Kitten Ids");

		...

		Log.debug("Received request to return specific Kitten "+id+".");

STEP 6: Run

	Now we are ready to run it
	and see how we did.

	node Server.js

	curl http://localhost:8080/kittens

	http://localhost:8080/kittens/asd35t244tv35sdf

	STOP

	set target=production

	node Server.js

	curl http://localhost:80/kittens

	http://localhost:80/kittens/h45y356uhjdsg4325
