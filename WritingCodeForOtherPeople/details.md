## Writing Code for Other People

#### Synopsis

The secret to being a truly great Software Engineer isn’t about knowing all the keywords, it isn’t about spewing out gobs and gobs of code, and it isn’t about writing the cleverest algorithm. No, the secret to being a truly great Software Engineer is the realization that your job is as much about communication as it is about coding. This talk will discuss why communication is critical in software and the ways in which we achieve this in our code.
