## The Morality of Code
=======

#### Synopsis

The act of writing code seems pretty innocuous. But what if it isn't? What if the code we write was being used in the wrong ways to hurt, to destroy, to exploit? What are the moral implications we should be considering as we hack away late into the night? How do we do the right thing in a world of software patents, privacy concerns, open source, and technological anarchy? Are we asking ourselves the right questions to find our own personal moral guidelines for writing code or are we just hoping for the best? This talk aims to not give anyone the answers but instead focus on the questions so that each of us can come to our own answers for ourselves.
