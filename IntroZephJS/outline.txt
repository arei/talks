An introduction to the ZephJS library. ZephJS is an extremely easy to use, simple to understand, ultra-light framework for defining and using Web Components. ZephJS is perfect for people writing component libraries, teams building applications or sites that just require a few custom components, or projects building whole applications that do not want the gigantic weight of a modern JavaScript browser framework. ZephJS simplifies the process of defining custom Web Components into a highly readable declarative structure that uses standard JavaScript, standard HTML markup, and standard CSS styling. And ZephJS weighs in at less than 20k minified!
